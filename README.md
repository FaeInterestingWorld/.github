# Interesting World Initiative

The initiative to create an Advisor that can provide guidance on potential challenges that the world may face was inspired by past explorations about 7 years ago: [Recurrent Neural Nets](https://github.com/danieltjw/novel-lyrics-synthesis), [Challenges Facing Humanity](https://github.com/danieltjw/challenges-facing-humanity).

Recent developments have shown surprising promise but it may take more time to reach a fully independent and capable Advisor.

This project has been self-funded by the author's previous work in the tech sector.
