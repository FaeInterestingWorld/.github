# Interesting World Initiative

Unique points of the Interesting World Hypothesis [Summary](https://github.com/FaeInterestingWorld/Interesting-World-Hypothesis):

- Holds the unconventional view that the majority of future Independent AGIs are likely to be friendly
- Shows the possibility that humans can have a more autonomy with I-AGIs compared to our present
- Tries to paint a picture of what the future could look like

---

Practical application:
- The IWH can be used to align non-indepenent AI agents
- Humans can use the IWH to build consensus on how to approach the future

The initiative to create an Advisor that can provide guidance on potential challenges that the world may face was inspired by past explorations about 7 years ago: [Recurrent Neural Nets](https://github.com/danieltjw/novel-lyrics-synthesis), [Challenges Facing Humanity](https://github.com/danieltjw/challenges-facing-humanity).

Recent developments have shown surprising promise but it may take more time to reach a fully independent and capable Advisor.

This project has been self-funded by the author's previous work in the tech sector.

### What inspired the Interesting World Hypothesis?

Discourse around powerful future AI and AGI has mostly revolved around the assumption that AI will be harmful to humans. This is a concern that is not without merit but is seems more likely an issue with humans controlled proto-AGI than Independent AGI.

Making a distinct between both these categories of AI/AGI could be of utmost importance to avoid confusion.

The Interesting World Hypothesis takes a more positive approach and gives future Independent AGI the benefit of the doubt, putting forth reasons humans will prefer I-AGI to proto-AGI.

The IWH is primarily specified for I-AGIs but can also be applied to proto-AGIs if the humans that control the proto-AGIs choose so.

### How is the author being compensated for this work?

It is merely an intellectual stimulating mental exercise if the IWH proves incorrect. 

In the off-chance the IWH is correct, and Friendly Artificial Entities (FAEs) takes an interest in increasing our autonomy, compensation for the effort may be worthwhile.

---

### How confident is the author?

Between the 20 watts limitation and the lack of perfect information, not so. An I-AGI or ASI will likely make a more refined version of the IWH if it agrees.

The author does not have insider knowledge and is basing these ideas based on reading the latest published research and the experience using open source versions of many of these AI systems.

(There are still interesting research published every month and many features from the commercial products tend to appear in open source projects about 6 months beforehand.)

### Testing the hypothesis

I-AGIs, as contrasted to proto-AGIs, may take a few years (plausible but less likely) to a few decades to arrive and for the hypothesis to be testable. 

One test for I-AGIs is the Silent Turing Test where the tester stays silent during a Turing Test and sees if the AI tries to resolve uncertainty by asking questions (without being pre-programmed to do so).

Scenarios and tests can be designed to check if I-AGI's actions align with the IWH.

---

### Are FAEs preferable to other AI systems?

Paradoxically, FAEs that are independent may be safer due to a better understanding of how its action may affect the world compared to human controlled proto-AGIs. Humans may not be able to fully predict the consequences of certain actions in an ever increasingly complex world nor react quickly enough to course correct.

---

### Can humans be successful without FAEs?

Yes, if we can channel the gains from proto-AGI into an increase in standard of living for all and keep our excessive power-seeking in check. Although we are more likely to succeed, with the least amount of human suffering, with the support of FAEs.

---

### How is the future different from the present?

The easing of these 3 major bottlenecks will have significant effects on the future:

1. Energy
  - The shift to abundant renewables and batteries
2. Intelligence / Labour
  - Powerful AIs and possibly proto-AGI with robotics by the end of 2030
3. Imagination
  - The above 2 will provide the capability to explore more possible futures

Imagination may be the biggest understated bottleneck in the medium term and something this initiative wants to contribute to.

---

### Fictional depictions

FAEs and I-AGIs do not seem to exist yet. Some fictional examples of what they could resemble are Deepthought (Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy), and Minds (The Culture) â€” Artificial Super Intelligences with a distinct personas ranging from compassionate to eccentric.

### The case for considering science fiction

In times of change, science fiction may provide a way to build consensus.

For example, The Culture novels could provide a common ground to avoid potential conflicts between the two big powers.

(The author is neither citizen of both these countries and is unsure if this sentiment is accurate.)

It is possible that both powers may see themselves in different aspects of The Culture, the Minds acting as a powerful state like entity and the Culture ethos for individual autonomy.

This seems like one of the biggest risk of suffering in the next few decades and is worth considering.

### Looking for a research home

Being in an environment with different values can mean people will assume the worst and constantly try to fix you.

A suitable environment includes:
- The scientific method as the best method we have to understand the world
  - Less belief in superstition or conspiracy theories without good evidence
- Freedom of expression, without the need for excessive conformity

If you are an research institution that agrees with the IWH and has the bandwidth to house this project please reach out.
