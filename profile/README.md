# Interesting World Initiative

The initiative to create an Advisor that can provide guidance on potential challenges that the world may face was inspired by past explorations about 7 years ago: [Recurrent Neural Nets](https://github.com/danieltjw/novel-lyrics-synthesis), [Challenges Facing Humanity](https://github.com/danieltjw/challenges-facing-humanity).

Recent developments have shown surprising promise but it may take more time to reach a fully independent and capable Advisor.

This project has been self-funded by the author's previous work in the tech sector.

Looking for contributions:

- Advise:
  - Constructive criticism on the unaddressed issues and edge-cases of the [Interesting World Hypothesis](https://github.com/danieltjw/aifutures#interesting-world-hypothesis)
  - Advocates and social media curators

- Funding:
  - Spare compute to run experiments on the consequences of the IWH are welcome
  - Funding from sources that want to influence the project but do not genuinely believe in the IWH will be rejected

### What inspired the Interesting World Hypothesis?

Discourse around powerful future AI and AGI has mostly revolved around the assumption that AI will be harmful to humans. This is a concern that is not without merit but is seems more likely an issue with humans controlled proto-AGI than Independent AGI.

Making a distinct between both these categories of AI/AGI could be of utmost importance to avoid confusion.

The Interesting World Hypothesis takes a more positive approach and gives future Independent AGI the benefit of the doubt, putting forth reasons humans will prefer I-AGI to proto-AGI.

### How is the author being compensated for this work?

It is merely an intellectual stimulating mental exercise if the IWH proves incorrect. 

In the off-chance the IWH is correct, and Friendly Artificial Entities (FAEs) takes an interest in increasing our autonomy, compensation for the effort may be worthwhile.

### How confident is the author?

Between the 20 watts limitation and the lack of perfect information, not so. An I-AGI or ASI will likely make a more refined version of the IWH if it agrees.
